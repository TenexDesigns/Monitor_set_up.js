Setting up three monitors ergonomically involves careful consideration of factors such as monitor size, placement, and viewing distance, as well as the users specific needs based on their tasks. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Choosing the Right Monitor Size: The best monitor size for a triple monitor setup is around 22-24 inches. Anything larger could increase neck movement and potentially lead to strain over time. While you might consider using an ultrawide curved monitor, this may require management software to increase productivity and could also increase screen glare[^[0]](https://otfocus.com/ergonomic-setup-for-three-monitors/).
Monitor Placement: The center monitor should be placed directly in front of you, with the second and third monitors on the right and left, respectively. These should be angled 30 degrees to the dominant eye. This setup allows you to spend most of the time using the center monitor, reducing neck strain[^[0]](https://otfocus.com/ergonomic-setup-for-three-monitors/).
Desk Setup: Youll need a large desk (62-72 inches) to accommodate three monitors. Ensure that the top of each monitor is level with your eye level. You might need a mount for three monitors that can be adjusted for height[^[0]](https://otfocus.com/ergonomic-setup-for-three-monitors/).

For instance, a video editor might use the center monitor for their timeline, the left monitor for media files, and the right screen for video output. A writer might use the center screen for drafting and the other two for research[^[0]](https://otfocus.com/ergonomic-setup-for-three-monitors/).
Distance and Position: Monitors should be about an arms length from your body, and at the same height (eye level or slightly lower if using corrective lenses)[^[1]](https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/ergonomics/office/monitor_positioning.html).
Ergonomic Assessment: Consider having an ergonomic assessment to eliminate positioning hazards and improve productivity[^[0]](https://otfocus.com/ergonomic-setup-for-three-monitors/).
Remember, while a triple monitor setup can provide efficiency and productivity benefits, it can also potentially increase neck fatigue and strain over extended periods. 
  Its essential to take regular breaks and adjust your setup as needed based on your comfort and the tasks youre
